<pre><span class="s0">In this directory you will find examples of ISAPI filters and extensions.</span>

<span class="s0">The filter loading mechanism works like this:</span>
<span class="s0">* IIS loads the special Python &quot;loader&quot; DLL.  This DLL will generally have a </span>
  <span class="s0">leading underscore as part of its name.</span>
<span class="s0">* This loader DLL looks for a Python module, by removing the first letter of</span>
  <span class="s0">the DLL base name.</span>
  
<span class="s0">This means that an ISAPI extension module consists of 2 key files - the loader</span>
<span class="s0">DLL (eg, &quot;_MyIISModule.dll&quot;, and a Python module (which for this example</span>
<span class="s0">would be &quot;MyIISModule.py&quot;)</span>

<span class="s0">When you install an ISAPI extension, the installation code checks to see if</span>
<span class="s0">there is a loader DLL for your implementation file - if one does not exist, </span>
<span class="s0">or the standard loader is different, it is copied and renamed accordingly.</span>

<span class="s0">We use this mechanism to provide the maximum separation between different</span>
<span class="s0">Python extensions installed on the same server - otherwise filter order and</span>
<span class="s0">other tricky IIS semantics would need to be replicated.  Also, each filter</span>
<span class="s0">gets its own thread-pool, etc.</span>
